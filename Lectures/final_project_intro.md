# Final Project Introduction

* [Final Project Assignment](../Assignments/final_image_processor.md)

* Team Formation
  + Teams will consist of 3 to 4 students
  + Send me an e-mail with the names of two to four people with whom you would
    like to join on a team.
  + Please send this e-mail by 9 am tomorrow morning.
  + If I do not receive an e-mail, I will assume you have no preference for 
    team members.
  + NO GUARANTEES are made about team members. 

* Team Working
  + Each team will decide how to divide up the work.  These divisions will be
    documented using GitHub functions such as milestones, issue tracking, etc.
    More about this will be discussed in the next lecture.
  + Confidential, individual feedback on team and team member performance will 
    be solicited.
