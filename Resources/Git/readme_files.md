# Information about README.md files
A README.md file is usually the first thing a potential users sees in your
repository.  So, it should give a good impression of the repository and contain
information useful to a user.

Depending on the nature of the project, the README file could contain the
following sections:
* __Background / Intro / Purpose__: Describe why this repository exists and a
brief overview of what it does.  
* __Install__:  How to set up the use of the project.  For this class, describing
the steps for making a virtual environment and installing the needed
packages using a `requirements.txt` file is likely sufficient.  But, also
include if certain helper files need to be copied into certain locations
on the user's computer or repository.
* __Usage__:  Detailed instructions on how the user starts the program and
then uses the program.  This can take the form of a detailed user's guide or
a bullet list.  As appropriate, the inclusion of a screen shot or two may
make use easier.  If the program uses input files, describe the format of 
those input files.  If the program generates output files, describe their
content and format.
* __Example__:  If your code is meant to be imported and referenced in a
users code, provide example code for how that would be done.
* __Details__: Describe any details you would like to share about how the code
works.  This is particularly important for this class if I ask for such
explanation in the program assignment.  Including an image or example of the
output is often helpful
* __API__: If your code has an API (for either a package or a server), describe
the API here.
* __Badges__: If you have status badges for licenses or CI, group
them somewhere, usually at the top under the title or at the bottom
* __License__: Indicate the license applied to this repository.
* __Author Information__:  Include information about the author and any 
contact information appropriate to be shared.
* __Links__:  If you used or referenced any other software packages or
information, include links to those.  Those links can either be in a 
dedicated section, or can be included in other descriptive text in other 
sections.

For this class, I am not looking for fancy graphics or marketing type of
information.  But, a neatly organized and formatted (i.e., use headings,
sections, and line breaks) 
README.md does make understanding what information you have included easier
to see and understand.  You don't have to "create" information to include
just to have each of the sections above and have a long file.  But, make sure
that the needed information is available and easy to find.  

At a minimum, every README should contain:
* Name/Title of the repository
* Your name
* Brief description of the purpose of the repository/code
* Instructions for starting your code (for example, virtual environment set-up
  instructions, what python file to invoke on the command line, etc.)
* If your program is interactive, a brief user's manual for how to use the
  program
* If there is code that should be modified before use (for example, if a
  filename needs to be edited in the code), include instructions for that.

Some assignments will specifically request additional information.

And, the README is a great place of informing me about anything related to 
your code that you think I should know.

## Links  

<https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme> has curated links to what
this user fields like are "awesome" readme files.  Take a look.  In the
examples, primarily look to see how they all use headings to easily
indicate what information is in the README and that information is nicely
formatted, not a long run-on sentence with no line breaks.
