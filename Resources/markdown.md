## Markdown Formatting
\*.md files indicate markdown formatting on render of content

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet for 
a good intro/summary.

Detailed documentation can be found at 
<https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github>.

The full "GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec" can be found at 
<https://github.github.com/gfm/>.

Markdown viewer plug-ins can be found for many text/code editors for editing/
viewing markdown files locally.

For notepad++, one option is MarkdownViewer++ 
(https://github.com/nea/MarkdownViewerPlusPlus).  __Note:__ If the rendered
markdown is not dynamically updating while entering text,  verify that you are
using the 32-bit version of Notepad++.  I have had some experience that the
dynamic render update does not work with the 64-bit version.
